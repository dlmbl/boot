    "- Loading images (This is important as images are the primary input to most deep learning models)\n",
    "- Normalizing images (This is important as it helps in faster convergence of models becuse it helps in reducing the scale of the input data and hence the scale of the gradients)\n",
    "- Cropping images (This is important as it helps in creating smaller images from the original images which is useful for training models in a memory efficient way)\n",
    "- Downsampling images (This is important as it helps in reducing the size of the images which is useful for training models in a memory efficient way)\n",
    "- Flipping images (This is important as it helps in creating new images from the original data which is useful for training models in a memory efficient way)\n",
    "- Batching images (As we train in a SGD manner, batching is important as it helps in training the model in a memory efficient way and smoothens the optimization process)\n",
